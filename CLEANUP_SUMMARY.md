# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup work performed on the Sandwich Platform codebase to improve organization and remove unnecessary files.

## Files Removed
### Temporary/Test Files
- `test_report.pdf` - Test report file
- `test_cookies.txt` - Test cookie file  
- `test_report_fixed.pdf` - Fixed test report
- `new_test.pdf` - New test file
- `final_test.pdf` - Final test file
- `working_test.pdf` - Working test file
- `working_report.csv` - Working report CSV
- `final_working_report.csv` - Final working report CSV

### Sensitive Files (Cookie Data)
- `cookies.txt` - Cookie data file
- `cookies_new.txt` - New cookie data file
- `admin_cookies.txt` - Admin cookie data file
- `fresh_cookies.txt` - Fresh cookie data file

### Empty Files
- `backup.sql` - Empty backup SQL file

## Files Organized

### Backup Files
Created `backups/` directory and moved:
- `messages_backup_20250706.json`
- `group_threads_backup_20250706.json` 
- `conversation_threads_backup_20250706.json`
- `messaging_backup_20250706_170012.sql`
- All `.backup` and `.broken` files from client source code

### Attached Assets Organization
Reorganized `attached_assets/` directory:
- **Screenshots**: Moved 158 screenshot files to `attached_assets/screenshots/`
- **Network Logs**: Moved 9 HAR files to `attached_assets/network-logs/`
- **Pasted Logs**: Moved 53 pasted log files to `attached_assets/pasted-logs/`

## Configuration Updates

### Enhanced .gitignore
Added comprehensive patterns for:
- Temporary and test files
- Cookie files (sensitive data)
- Backup files
- HAR files (browser network logs)
- Screenshots
- Python cache files
- IDE files
- Log files
- Environment files
- Build artifacts
- OS generated files

## Results
- **Root directory**: Reduced from ~280+ files to 40 files
- **Attached assets**: Organized from 283 files to 67 files in root
- **Better organization**: Files are now logically grouped and documented
- **Security**: Removed sensitive cookie data from version control
- **Maintainability**: Added documentation for backup and asset directories

## Recommendations
1. **Regular cleanup**: Schedule periodic reviews of temporary files and screenshots
2. **Backup rotation**: Consider implementing a backup retention policy
3. **Asset management**: Review and clean up old screenshots and logs quarterly
4. **Documentation**: Keep README files updated as the project evolves

## Next Steps
- Review the organized files to ensure nothing important was moved
- Consider implementing automated cleanup scripts for future maintenance
- Set up regular backup archiving for the backups directory
